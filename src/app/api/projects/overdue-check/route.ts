/**
 * Raises a "project is overdue" notification for every project whose timeline
 * has passed while it's still unfinished.
 *
 * Run on demand — called when someone opens the projects list — because there's
 * no scheduler in this app. That means the notice appears the first time anyone
 * uses the app after the deadline passes, not at midnight on the dot. The
 * dedupe key is what makes that safe: without it the same notice would be
 * raised on every page load by every viewer.
 *
 * The key includes the timeline it went overdue against, so extending a
 * deadline and then missing the new one raises a fresh notice.
