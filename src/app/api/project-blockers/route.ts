 * Raise a blocker against a project.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT write a daily_updates row. Doing that was the old
 * behaviour and it made "Add blocker" post a phantom update that showed up in
 * the tracker, Daily Updates and the author's activity feed. A blocker is
 * project state, not a report of work done.
 *
 * Permission is enforced by the RLS policy from migration 038 (hold
 * `blocker.manage`, and either `project.manage.all` or be on the project), so a
 * denial arrives as a 42501 to pass through rather than being re-checked here.
